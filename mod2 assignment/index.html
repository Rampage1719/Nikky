  <p class="content">When a good thing goes bad it's not the end of the world,it's just the end of a world, that you had with one girl And she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting and it's all because she don't want things to change.</p>

    <p class="content">Tell me what you gon' do to me,confrontation ain't nothin' new to me,you can bring a bullet, bring a sword, bring a morgue but you can't bring the truth to me,eff you and all your expectations,I don't even want your congratulation,I recognize your false confidence and calculated promises all in your conversation</p>
